1) the sprint goal:
Our group's sprint goal for Sprint1 was to implement all user stories and design patterns and fix all the bugs in our final project. We would like to implement tournament_mode feature, suggest_moves feature, unsuggest_moves feature, display_time feature(add other features we worked on). We would like to have a working version of our project by Saturday, Dec-04 and get ready for the live demo on Monday, Dec-06. Also, we need to start and finish our presentation and make sure that everyone in the group is involved in the process whether it be presenting our project or demonstrating the code aspect of the project. Throughout this whole process we would like to make better use of git flow and do more pull requests than the previous sprints. 
 2) all stories for this sprint and any decisions to add/delete stories:
The stories which we are implementing include 2.1 - a textbox in our UI which is used to enter the moves that a human would like to make,  story 2. 2 which includes a label which updates whether the selected move was successful or not, story 2.3 an audio sound which occurs when a move occurs by a human, story 2.4 a tournament game mode in which multiple players play each other and the winners of each respective game play each other in the end, story 2.5 a suggested moves feature which suggests the smartest move for a human to complete, story 2.6 which is a timer that keeps track of the time elapsed in seconds and displays it on the gui as a label, story 2.7 which saves the current state of the board, and story 2.8 which restarts game the game with a new fresh board. User story 2.9 was added in this sprint, which opens a saved game. This was added to go with the save game feature.
3) a current assessment of team capacity (i.e. how much you expect to complete):
We are on track to complete all of our eight features. 
4) participants in the sprint process (i.e. who did what):,
Arushi completed the observable pattern to implement the audio for a move, as the piece moved, by updating the Move, View, and creating an AudioControl class. She also completed the successLabel feature which lets the player know if their move was successful or not. 
Jasmine completed the Iterator pattern which is user story 2.5 (suggested moves) by implementing the IteratorBoard class and its methods. She also worked on some bugs for save game and open game features.
Osama completed the timer feature which is user story 2.6, created a timer class and used the view class to implement gui elements to show the elapsed time. He also worked to fix bugs on the restart feature and on other files.
