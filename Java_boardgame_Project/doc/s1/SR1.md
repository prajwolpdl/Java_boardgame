SPRINT 1:
1. All group members attended all meetings (3 meetings to be exact)  
2. As mentioned in the sprint1.md file, 2 new user stories were added in this sprint (1.7, 1.8), so there are a total of 8 user stories. Out of the 8 user stories, 4 were completed: 1.1, 1.2, 1.7, 1.8). So four user stories (1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6) are unfinished at the moment and will be completed in sprint 2.  
3. Practices to continue to next sprint: communicating ideas to each other clearly  
4. Harmful practices to stop for the next sprint/improvements: Communicate early, even if you can not get your allotted part done. Learn how to use gitflow. Try to complete all requirements a few hours before the deadline to avoid any last minute issues. We should not start our work late and balance our schedules to fit school work and work. Plan ahead of time.  
5. Worst experience for sprint 1: Using git flow as we faced last minute issues regarding merging our files for multiple people. Inability to set up a proper schedule to meet due to some members having work till late night.  
6. Best experience for sprint 1: Collaborating with my group members. Helping each other out to resolve issues.
